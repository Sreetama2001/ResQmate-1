## Motivation
With the rapid change in climate and increasing global warming , quick response to a disaster saves a lot of lives.
The motivation for the project stems from the realization that current post-disaster management systems are often fragmented and inefficient. In the aftermath of a disaster, the ability to quickly and effectively collect, analyze, and disseminate critical information is essential for the safety and well-being of affected communities. However, the lack of a centralized platform for data management and communication can lead to confusion, duplication of efforts, and wasted resources.

The project is driven by the belief that by making post-disaster management more efficient and effective, we can better serve the needs of affected communities and aid organizations. We hope that by providing this open-source platform, we can help save lives and improve recovery efforts in the aftermath of disasters.
